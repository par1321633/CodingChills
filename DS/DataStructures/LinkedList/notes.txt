Linked List:
Composed of Nodes and Pointer.
Last Node points to Null.


-- Can be used to implement stacks and queue.
-- No Random Access like we have an array
-- Many basic operation such as obtaining the last node or append require sequencial scanning.

Advantages:
- Dynamic
- efficent to manuplates items at begining
- easy implementation

Disadvantages:
- Extra memory because of refrences
- Access, Reverse Tracking


Operations
-- Traverse
-- Insert Item at Begin
-- Insert at last
-- Insert at any index
-- Remove first O(1)
-- Remove any item O(N)


Double Linked List:
2 Reference Stored:
1 Point to Prev Node while another point to next node.

Linked List vs Arrays:
SEARCH :-
    Array List is better than Linked List O(1), Random Access

DELETION :-
    Linked List Better, In LL just to remove reference while in ARRAY we need to update following items.

MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
    LL need more memory. Array is memory friendly
     OPS            LL    Array
    SEARCH         O(N)   O(1)
    INSERT         O(1)   O(N)
    INSERT at end  O(N)   O(1)
    Waste Space    O(N)    0
