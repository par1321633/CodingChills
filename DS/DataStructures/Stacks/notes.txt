ADT (Interface)
Functions : pop(), push(), peek()
LIFO
Implemented using Arrays and Linked List

pop() -> O(1)
peek() -> O(1)
Only difference is pop remove items from stack.

Applications:
-- stack oriented programming languages
-- Graph Algo Depth First Search Algo
-- Finding Euler Cycle in graph
-- Find strongly connected components in graph

############## Stacks in Memory Management ###############################
Stacks in Memory Management (stacks, heaps)
Stacks Memory
Every time function declares new variable it is pushed to stack.
And when function exits all the varaible pushed in stack are freed.
Limited Memory

Heaps Memory
Not Automatic, We have to deallocate these memory chunks.
Reference Types and Object are Stored in Heap.
Memory Leak Issue
